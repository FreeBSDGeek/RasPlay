This is the RasPlay todo list:

- Detect the sound device instead of using hard coded ALSA ID's.
  Right not it will probably only work with my USB sound DSP.

- Create routines to parse an MPD playlist or create our own 
  playlist system.  Some Radio stations change the playlist title
  when playing to the song name. This then makes it hard to 
  display the station ID when changing channels.

- Faster switching in and out of airplay mode.

- More changes to use both lines of the display.  Scroll mode
  also needs some adjusting.

- Display station instead of song when changing channels. (See
  second note above).

- Add a way to load or dynamically pull playlists or add in 
  Internet Radio stations.

- Track down BUG that leaves display in unknown state when exiting
  daemon.  Strange characters on the display and usually reqires
  a power cycle. Intermitent.
